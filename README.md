# SmartDiag_Tech - AI Medical Diagnosis Tool

SmartDiag is a project developed during the Le Wagon Data Science Bootcamp. This tool uses AI to analyze medical images and diagnose several conditions with high accuracy. The main features of SmartDiag include brain tumor detection, chest X-ray analysis for COVID-19 detection, and more.

## Features

- **Brain Tumor Detection**: Diagnose three types of brain tumors using MRI scans:
  - Meningioma Tumor
  - Glioma Tumor
  - Pituitary Tumor

- **Chest X-ray Analysis**: Detect infections, including COVID-19, using chest X-ray images.

- **Symptom-Based Predictions**: Predict diseases based on patient symptoms, mimicking a virtual doctor.

- **AI-Driven Diagnostics**: Analyze medical images for various conditions to assist in early diagnosis and decision-making.
