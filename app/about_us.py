    Our dedicated team brings a wealth of experience and skills to SmartDiag. Learn more about the individuals driving our mission [add our picture here!!].

    
    *Model Performance*
    "We have implemented the VGG16 model as the cornerstone of our diagnostic approach, utilizing its robust capabilities in analyzing medical images.
    Trained on a dataset comprising 7000 chest X-ray images and 3500 Brain MRI images, our model has demonstrated commendable accuracy in predicting results.

    *Ongoing Efforts and Future Goals*
    "As we continually strive for excellence, our commitment to enhancing performance remains unwavering. We envision expanding our dataset in the near future, a crucial step towards refining our model's predictive accuracy.
    The pursuit of a larger and more diverse dataset aligns with our mission to deliver even more precise diagnostic outcomes.and aslo it's our goal to use more
    information about our patient like gender, historical medical information, or symptoms of disease to have more accurate
    diagnosis and be an assistant for doctor to reduce making mistake in doctor's diagnosis!
    
    *more information about model*
    User-Friendly Explanation:
    "For those interested in the technical details, the VGG16 model, known for its depth and effectiveness, serves as the backbone of our diagnostic process.
    Its architecture allows for intricate feature extraction, enabling accurate predictions from medical images.
